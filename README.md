# Linkding addon

This addon is based on alpine docker image made by https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding

Without any user settings, the addon is installed and the interface is accessible, but nothing much can be done.
With the user settings, the admin user, if needed is created, and will be available. Users can then be created.

I didn't expose all settings (yet), let's see if it is needed at some point.

Happy bookmarkingâ€¯!
